Hi,
there are couple of bugs in API List Movies function.
Sorting movies by peers, seeds, like_count dont work.
Returning the list with the Rotten Tomatoes rating included dont work.
Its not possible to search movies by IMDb Title Code, Actor Name/IMDb Code, Director Name/IMDb Code.

For example these 2 URLs return the same value:
https://yts.ag/api/v2/list_movies.json&sort_by=like_count&with_rt_ratings=true
https://yts.ag/api/v2/list_movies.json&sort_by=seeds&with_rt_ratings=false

If you are interested I can report more bugs.

Thanks.
